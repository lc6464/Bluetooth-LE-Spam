This project focuses on utilizing the built-in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
functionality of Android smartphones to create Phantom Bluetooth Device Advertisements,
similar to what is known, for instance, in the case of the Flipper Zero. While there
are other apps available that provide similar functionality, the objective of this
app is to enhance convenience and user-friendliness in the process.
